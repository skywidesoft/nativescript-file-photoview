## Background
I have an app that reads images from a protected REST API endpoints, and download into NativeScript as ImageSource. I need a photo viewer so when the thumbnail was tapped, the viewer for the photo will display with zoom functionality.

So I need a photo popup viewer that supports NS's ImageSource. I found the nativescript-photoviewer that works well in supporting this, but for Android, it only supports external URL strings that I can't provide.

Also, I found that passing an ImageSource directly to an Android library is not that strict forward (it easily cause out of memory error).

As a result, I come up a simple approach as follows:
* The image was download as NS's ImageSource instances
* When user click on the thumbnail, the ImageSource will be saved to the application cache
* The image file path will be passed to the above FilePhotoView Android library for pop up and display
  * The FilePhotoView use Glide and PhotoView behind the scene

## Installation
Run  ```tns plugin add nativescript-file-photoview``` in your ROOT directory of your project.

## Limitations
Captions only available on iOS. Android only supports array of string urls as datasource. 

## Usage
The usage is very simple. Import "nativescript-file-photoview" module and create a instance of it. Call the ```show(string)``` (string is the local storage image file path) function to present the photo. 
The ```show()``` function accept a singe parameter, a string.

```js
import { Component, OnInit } from "@angular/core";
import { Observable } from 'rxjs/Rx';
import * as nshttp from 'http';
import * as fs from 'file-system';
import * as enums from 'ui/enums';

// Import the plugin
import { FilePhotoview } from 'nativescript-file-photoview';

@Component({
    selector: "ns-app",
    templateUrl: "app.component.html",
})
export class AppComponent implements OnInit { 

    imageUrl: string;

    filePhotoView = new FilePhotoview();

    ngOnInit() {

        this.imageUrl = 'https://controller1.skywidesoft.com/images/sample1.jpg';

    }

    viewPhoto() {
        console.log('View Photo');
        console.log(`imageUrl: ${this.imageUrl}`);

        // Download image and save file to application cache
        Observable.from(nshttp.getImage(this.imageUrl)).subscribe(
            image => {

                // This is the application's cache folder
                let folder = fs.knownFolders.temp();

                // Construct a unique file name for saving the image file
                let fileName = new Date().getTime() + '.jpg';
                let path = fs.path.join(folder.path, fileName);

                // Save the file
                image.saveToFile(path, enums.ImageFormat.jpg);
                console.log(`File: ${path} saved successfully`);

                // Display the photo
                this.filePhotoView.show(path);

            }
        );
    }

}
```
